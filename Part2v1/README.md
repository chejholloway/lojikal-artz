This project implements a custom encoding algorithm to convert strings into integers,which enables data obfuscation.
 
Rigorous testing ensures accurate encoding and decoding, maintaining data integrity throughout the process.

## Code Quality Overview

###Useful Tests: 
- The code includes tests that validate the encoding and decoding processes with different inputs, ensuring robust functionality.

### Documentation: 
- JSDoc comments provide insight into function purposes and usage, while inline comments explain crucial steps, promoting clear understanding.

###Consistent Style: 
- The code adheres to Prettier's uniform style, which improves readability and maintainability.

### Instructions:

- To run tests, uncomment the last line in the code.
- To run the project, have NodeJS installed, and from the directory where the code resides, run the `npx live-server` command.
