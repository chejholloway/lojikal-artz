# Project Overview

This project implements a custom encoding algorithm to convert strings into integers,which enables data obfuscation.

Rigorous testing ensures accurate encoding and decoding, maintaining data integrity throughout the process.

## Code Quality Overview

### Useful Tests

- The code includes tests that validate the encoding and decoding processes with different inputs, ensuring robust functionality.

### Documentation

- JSDoc comments provide insight into function purposes and usage, while inline comments explain crucial steps, promoting clear understanding.

### Consistent Style

- The code adheres to Prettier's uniform style, which improves readability and maintainability.

### Instructions

- To run the project, have NodeJS installed, and from the directory where the code resides, run the `npx live-server` command.

### Redo

- My apologies, I accidentally sent my code before I was done.  This code was my intention from the beginning
- The encoder/decoder module is in it's own folder (externalized), the functions are exported, and it's ready to be packed up and pushed to the npmjs registry
- I used pure Web Components to Illustrate that no external libraries are needed to create re-usable components.
